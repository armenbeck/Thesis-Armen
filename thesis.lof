\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces WAND: Workflow Automation for Nested Decision is a software tool with graphical user interface to automate experiment set-up and data analysis by incorporating information on several assay formats, detailed error handling for specific formats and automated data analysis to minimize human error. The user specifies different assay parameters, conditions, and scoring weights, generating comprehensive reports as excel sheets for further analysis. (A) The file selection panel allows WAND to access and process plate reader files. (B) The antigen selection and screening type panels allow the user to specify the appropriate experimental descriptors for a given plate reader file. (C&D) The experimental details, and subsequent panels, are displayed such that prior specifications dictate the inputs available that ensure proper descriptor entry. (E) ID entry is performed in a separate window which allows users to input the appropriate name of reagents. (F) Dynamic scoring entry allows for users to modify the interpretation of plate reader files such that desired analytical values are given higher pertinence post analysis.\relax }}{51}{figure.caption.48}%
